    You have long heard the story of a ship at the base of a mountain. 
Knowing that no one would build a ship so far from the ocean, you have
dismissed the tale as serfs' superstition.

    Then, one day, you came across an ancient manuscript.  It told of a great
tidal wave which hit the land long ago, carrying houses for miles inland.  You
wonder if a ship could have been carried as far as the mountains.  With your
curiosity aroused, you set off with some of your Nobles in search of the ship. 
{f6}
    After many weeks of searching, you are about to give up when one of your
men gives a shout!  You look up, and see he is pointing at something.
{f6}
    Climbing to the top of a small hill, you look in the direction he is
pointing.  There, before your eyes, is the rotting remains of a small ship. 
Upon closer examination, you find some cannon, which may be useful,
otherwise, the ship is a total loss.
{f6}
   You gain 6 cannons!
