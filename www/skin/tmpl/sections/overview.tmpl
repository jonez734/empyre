      <strong>Asimov</strong> is a Python package and interactive real-time vision system that can also be run as a standalone program. 
      It processes camera input via OpenCV, recognizes hand gestures using cvzone (which wraps MediaPipe), and provides configurable 
      visual effects and “glitches.” In <code>main_virtualcam.py</code>, cvzone is also used for face detection to implement a 
      “privacy eyes” overlay. Asimov includes utility functions for distance checks, logging, and safe path computation, 
      making it suitable for building interactive applications or demos.

    <p>
      <strong>Usage modes:</strong> Asimov can either be imported as a Python package in your own scripts, or run directly using 
      <code>python -m asimov</code>, which will execute a pluggable main loop such as <code>main_virtualcam.py</code>. 
      This allows you to quickly launch demos with gesture recognition, glitch effects, and virtual camera output.

      <strong>Virtual camera support:</strong> Compatible with OBS (tested) and Zoom (tested). 
      meet.jit.si (Jitsi) does not currently work (black preview), and Discord shows the virtual camera in the 
      dropdown but displays a black frame.

      <strong>Legacy demos:</strong> GTK-based demos exist but are no longer actively maintained. OpenGL-based demos exist but are not used in production.
