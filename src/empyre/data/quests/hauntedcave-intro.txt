With the need for good :horse: horses, and also having heard of wild :horse: horses in the mountains, you set out with some of your nobles to try to find them.
Questioning the people you meet you discover that the :horse: horses have been seen near a haunted cave.  Not believing in ghosts, you head for the location.
Finally you find the cave, seeing one of the :horse: horses entering it.  Quietly you and your men approach the cave.  You are within a hundred yards when you hear some spooky sounds coming from it.
Determined to discover the secret of the sounds, you advance toward the cave.  Upon reaching the cave's entrance, you see daylight quite far back. Boldly entering, you discover a tunnel through a mountain.  The tunnel distorted the sounds you heard, producing the "ghostly" manifestations!
There is a hidden valley on the other end of the tunnel.  In the valley you find a herd of :horse: horses.
