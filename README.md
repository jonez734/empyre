## todo
- [x] make sure all attributes with a price have a singular and plural defined.
- [x] missing "each" on the end of the prompt in investments()
- [x] maint mode should prompt for handle, default to currentloginname, tab-complete.
- [ ] palaces
  * player.palaces in 10% increments sometimes
  * other places, you buy a complete palace
  * combat
  * rank
- [x] change place where main() calls title() so it is after the clear screen / initscreen calls.
- [ ] inputplayername has *case sensitive* tab complete
- [ ] completer for edit player profile attribute
  * attributes are not shortened like in player.status()
  * can this be done cleanly using readline?
- [ ] timber
- [x] scratch news
- [ ] bbs edit -> empyre coin exchange rate no longer hard-coded.
