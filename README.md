## todo
- [x] make sure all attributes with a price have a singular and plural defined.
- [x] missing "each" on the end of the prompt in investments()
- [x] maint mode should prompt for handle, default to currentloginname, tab-complete.
- [ ] palaces -- some places treat player.palaces as 10%, other times (like when buying one), it's 100%.
- [x] change place where main() calls title() so it is after the clear screen / initscreen calls.
- [ ] inputplayername has *case sensitive* tab complete
- [ ] when I double-tab at the maint -> edit player profile -> attribute prompt, the items are not shortened like they are in the player.status().
- [ ] timber
- [ ] scratch news
- [ ] bbs edit -> empyre coin exchange rate no longer hard-coded.
